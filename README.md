Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project involved developing a thermostat system that integrates multiple peripherals to control and monitor the temperature. The system reads temp data from a TMP006 sensor, adjusts the setpoint based on button inputs, controls and LED to simulate turning on a heater, and sends the status updates via UART. 

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I was particularly successful in designing the task scheduler to handle periodic tasks as well as extensive code documentation through comments and documents to make the code more understandable and easier to maintain. 

Where could you improve?

I believe I could have done better in tracking down the bug that caused my readings to all over the place. My temperature would start at 0C and fluctuate all the way from -35 to 80 c. I am not sure if this is the sensor on my board or a conversion issue. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Cloud services and debugging tools would be wonderful additions for these types of systems. Advanced debugging tools like an oscilloscope allow for better peripheral debugging since hardware is a key component to this type of development. Cloud service research will also be a major boon to add to a project for enhanced cloud integration. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The skills learned in this course will mainly help me with embedded systems programming as well as understanding and implementing task scheduling. Both of these skills are heavily transferrable to RTOS based projects or any embedded systems project. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Detailed comments are my main source of readability. I have also provided extensive documentation breaking down how the code works and my approach to the design. My coding style is also fairly consistent with should enhance collaboration as well.
